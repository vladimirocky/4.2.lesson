- feat: added supports the require() of the javascript source files directly in pug.\
  It is no longer necessary to define a js file in webpack entry-point.\
  For example, using the `pug-plugin` now is possible usage of source js files in pug:
  ```pug
  script(src=require('./main.js'))
  ```

- fix: update pug-loader to fix path error in Windows when watching dependencies 

## 1.4.0 (2022-02-18)
- BREAKING CHANGE (low probability):
  When using required style in pug, like `link(rel='stylesheet' href=require('./styles.css'))` then no need anymore the `type: 'asset/resource'` in the rule for styles.\
  **UPDATE** your `webpack.config.js`: remove in the rule for styles (css, scss, sass, etc.) the `type` and the `generator` fields.\
  Following is enough to extract CSS everywhere:
  ```js
  {
    test: /\.(css|sass|scss)$/,
    // type: 'asset/resource', <-- remove the type property
    // generator: { 'assets/css/[name].[contenthash:8].css' } <-- remove the generator property
    use: [ 'css-loader', 'sass-loader' ],
  },
  ```
  To define a filename for extracted CSS use the option `filename` in the `extractCss` module:
  ```js
  new PugPlugin({
    modules: [
      PugPlugin.extractCss({
        filename: 'assets/css/[name].[contenthash:8].css'
      }),
    ],
  }),
  ```
